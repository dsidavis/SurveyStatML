# Motivation/Purpose

+ Get feedback from you on
   + what you already know,
   + what you think you know 
   + what you want to know
   + what level of detail

+ We'll adapt for next week
   + cover different topics
   + revisit today's topics with different focus
   + move up/down a level of technical detail
   + focus more on software, case studies, theory.

+ Concept for a course in Data Science for a graduate Designated Emphasis and Graduate Academic Certificate.

---

# Today

+ General concepts of ML, Data Analysis, Vocabulary
+ Refresher about sampling distribution.
+ Classification

--
##     Why classification.
     + Easier to understand - more heuristic.
     + Prediction/Classification rather than inference.
     + Some nice general concepts
     + Some modern(ish) concepts
     + Don't teach as much as non-parametric classification/prediction methods in class, relative to  regression.
     + Regression, regularization, etc. somewhat/slightly more complex

<!--
     + We won't go to deep learning today, but figure out whether
        it would be good for next week.
-->

# Garbage In, Garbage Out
### If you mislead machine learning, it will mislead you.

+ Stat Machine Learning Methods are important, but are just one part of the data pipeline

+ Frame question incorrectly, result is *severely challenged*.

+ Measure the wrong concept, ...

+ Sample incorrectly, inference about target population is *mostly flawed/unreliable*.
   + Many people don't consider issues of sampling bias/found data.
   + Sampling bias â‰  Estimation bias.

+ Mess up data acquisition systematically, *inference is broken*.
+ Clean data poorly, inference is *often challenged*.

### The data pipeline can fail at *any* stage.

---

# Example: SPAM Email

+ Collect representative emails
 + Not my email - unless personalized filter
 + Historical data - spam changing over time.

+ Get data from server, mbox, ...

+ Read their the metadata, text, attachments.

+ Clean stop words, stem, ...

+ How much do we care about missing emails that are relevant to me?
+ How much spam can I deal with it?
+ What are the costs of Type I and II errors.

+ Evaluate different approaches.

+ Feature engineering



---
# Why so many methods? 

<center style="padding-top: 10px"><i>"There is no free lunch in statistics: no one method dominates all others over all possible data sets. On a particular data set, one specific method may work best, but some other method may work better on a similar but different data set."</i></center>
<div style="float: right">Introduction to Statistical Learning with R</div>

<div style="clear:both; padding-top: 40px"/>

+ So need to consider different methods

+ Need to be aware that your "best" method may be specific to your particular sample.
   + Get a different sample, different method might be "best".

+ Data analysis still requires human decisions.

---

# Qualitatively Robust Results
### Compare Alternative Methods

+ If your (qualitative) conclusions are very different (i.e. very sensitive)
  to the choice of method, you probably have a problem.

+ So we like to use several methods and compare the results.

+ Exploratory analysis of differences may reveal new features via residuals.

+ In some cases, we will combine the results from multiple methods - ensembles.

###      So let's not get wedded to particular methods.

---

# Methods versus Data Analysis

+ Understandable focus on methods.
   + What is taught in classes.
   + If they work adequately, not much thought needed.

+ Data exploration, feature engineering critical.

+ Important to define loss function for "real" question.
  + Loss function "defines" the method.
  + Generic methods (mostly) define the loss function.

---
# Purpose of Machine Learning

## Prediction versus Classification versus Estimation

+ Prediction
   + Predict continuous/integer valued response given predictor values

+ Classification
   + Predicting Categorical outcome from given predictor values
   + Binary outcome or multi-class outcome

+ Prediction v Classification
   + Magnitude of error versus Misclassification
   + Cost of misclassification to different groups

+ Estimation
   + Interpretation of parameters in model

---

# Supervized, Unsupervized, Semi-supervized


+ Supervized - have values for response, and predictors

+ Unsupervized - don't have response, only predictors

+ Semi-supervized -
   + have predictors for all observations
   + responses for some.
   + Can we use the unlabelled observations ?

---

# Parametric, non-Parametric.

+ 2 types of parametrics

  + Distributional assumptions about variables versus None
      + Normal, Exponential versus Ranks, Permutations, ...

  + Assume functional form (e.g. linear) verus no functional form.
    + Linear model
    + lowess smoothing

---

# Basics

+ Characterize the following panels.

<a href="CompareDistributions.png"><img src="CompareDistributions.png" width="60%"></a>

---

--
+ Are these densities the same?

--
+ How can you tell?

--
+ What makes them different?

<!-- sampling variability.   A very small bit of bias in the density estimation? -->

---
# With a Reference Distribution

<a href="CompareDistributionsExp.png"><img src="CompareDistributionsExp.png" width="60%"></a>

---

# Sampling Variability

+ Start with population

+ Take sample $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$.

+ Estimate population parameter $\hat\theta_n = T(x_1, ..., x_n)$  

+ Interested in ___Sampling Distribution of Estimator___

---

## What is the sampling distribution

+ Distribution of  $\hat\theta_n$ across different samples of same size
+ From this, can compute SE, quantiles, confidence intervals. 
+ May be a joint distribution for two or more statistics.

---
# Estimating 95th Quantile

+ Sampling distribution of .95th quantile?
+ of maximum of sample?

---

<img src="SamplingDistribution.png" width="80%"/>

<div style="float: right">
    + Density for small sample exceeds 1
    + 2 peaks in 30 observation density
</div>

---

# Sampling Distribution

+ Exact formula

+ Approximate with Central Limit Theorem
   + Assumptions?

---

# Bootstrap

+ Generate new samples based on our original sample
  + Same sample size
  + Parametric versus Non-parametric

+ Create $X^* = {x_1^*, ..., x_n^*}$ from sample
  + Non-parametric:  sample n values from $x_1, ..., x_n$  **with replacement**

  + Parametric: Assume we know distributional form of X, e.g., exponential
    + Generate n values from Exponential($\hat{\lambda}$), i.e. Exponential($\bar{X}$)
    + Estimate parameter from original sample.
    + Use that distribution to generate $x_1^*, ..., x_n^*$

+ Compute statistic(s) from $X^*$ - $T(X^*)$

+ Repeat B times

+ Empirical distribution is estimate of sampling distribution.


---
# Bootstrap Sampling

+ Key concept
    + Relationship between population and original sample is "same" as relationship between original sample and each bootstrap sample

+ Bootstrap sampling needs to mimic getting a different original sample
   + Depends on what you know/believe.

+ Example above simple
   + random sample, independent and identically distributed $x^*_i$

+ More complicated when 
   + stratified, clustered sample
   + correlated in time or space by design

---

# Classification

---

+ Classifying new observations into one of g classes/labels

+ Given $X_1, ..., X_p$ predictors

+ May know $\pi_1, ..., \pi_g$ - the proportion of each class in the population.

+ Sample of n observations Y<sub>i</sub>, X<sub>i1</sub>, Y<sub>i2</sub>, Y<sub>ip</sub>



---

+ Find ways to separate observations from different groups.

+ Like clustering, want observations in same class to be more like each other and more different than observations in other classes.

<a href="Cloud2.png"><img src="Cloud2.png" width="85%"></a>


---

+ But perhaps a class has bimodal distribution

<a href="Cloud3.png"><img src="Cloud3.png" width="85%"></a>

<a href="Cloud4.png"><img src="Cloud4.png" width="85%"></a>

# k Nearest Neighbors


+ Premise: Observations that are close together in X/Covariate space will be similar in Y

+ "close", "similar"
  + Need a measure of distance.


+ Classifier
   + Given a labeled training set $Y_i$, x<sub>i1</sub>, x<sub>i2</sub>, ..., x<sub>ip</sub>, i = 1, ..., n.
   + For a given distance measure, and number k, say k = 3
   + Predict the group of a new observation $x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$ with
     + Find the k = 3 closest training points to new observation
     + Find the most common class of those k "neighbors" 

---

# How does choice of k influence classifier?

+  k = 1

--

+ k = n/2

--

+ k = n


---

# Bias-Variance Tradeoff

$$\hbox{Test MSE} = E(y - \hat{f}(x_0))^2 = Var(\epsilon) + Var(\hat{f}(x_0)) + Bias(\hat{f}(x_0))^2$$

+ Bias = $f(x_0) - \hat{f}(x_0)$
   + structural difference between truth and our model.
   + Doesn't get better with more data.

+ $Var(\hat{f})$ - how much does $\hat{f}$ change across different samples.
   + Sampling variability of the statistic/model.
   + Should decrease with larger sample size.

+ $Var(\epsilon)$ - Irreducible, inherent randomness for each observation.
  +  Can't get prediction below this (without changing this itself).


<!-- How do we reduce variance?  Average "observations".  Suggests ensembles.
   Increase the number
   -->


---

# Measuring Fit

## Confusion Matrix


+ For each group, count the number of observations from that group classified into groups 1, 2, ..., g.

<table>
    <tr><td/><td>Predicted</td></tr>
<tr>
    <td>Truth</td>
    <td>
<table border="1">
    <tr><td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>....</td> <td>g</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td> <td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>...</td><td></td><td></td><td></td> </tr>
    <tr><td>g</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table></td>
</tr>
</table>

+ Want diagonal values to be large.

+ Ideally, 0's off diagonal.


---

# kNN Details


+ How to determine k ?
+ Distance measure?
   + Standardize or not?
   + How to deal with categorical data?
+ Should we weight the votes of the k neighbors?

---
# Determine k, distance, ...
## Cross-validation

+ 2 purposes-
    + tuning/nuisance parameter estimation
    + estimation of  test MSE/Misclassification
<!--         + How does this relate to bootstrap? -->

+ Concept: Compare 2 or more models based on how well they do on new test data (not training data).

+ We don't necessarily have test data.
   + Ideally we do.
   + Sample =  Training data $\cup$ Validation data  $\cup$ Final Test data

---
# Cross-Validation

+ Split training data into  - training + test
+ Fit model on training data - $G_\hbox{Train}(x)$
+ Classify test data with $G_\hbox{Train}(x)$

--

+ What's wrong with this?

--

+ Results depend on which observations are in test set.

--

+ Is this Bias or Variance?

--

+ Want every observation in training set to be in exactly one test set.


---
# Leave-One-Out CV

+ One approach
   + test set is one observation, training is everything else
   + new training set has n - 1 observations.

+ Good or bad?

---

# K-fold CV

+ Sample size is (k-1)*n of original, so not quite the same training set. Some upward bias of test MSE since training set not as big, but okay.
   + k = 5, 10 common.
 
+ Leave-one-out-CV improves this.
	   + Avoid randomness of repeated randomly selecting train-test split.  Deterministic and all observations in 1 test set.
	   + Correlation across training sets, however.

+ k-fold versus LOOCV

--

  + Less fitting, less computational time.
  + bias-variance
     + k-fold is slightly more biased that LOOCV
     + but the LOOCV fitted models are more correlated since share observations.
         + So higher variance.
         + Fewer effective independent observations.
         + See <a href="corVars.R">corVars.R</a>
    

---
# Cross Validation

+ Can do EDA on cross validation.
+ look not just at the total error/misclassification, but which training sets did badly.
    + Is there some pattern, outliers  due to unusual test set.

+ Need to sample intelligently, mimicing the original sampling scheme/design.

<!--
+ Get some indication of distribution of test MSE values.
+ Different sample size, but still useful.
   -->

---
# Linear Discriminant Analysis

+ Handles multiple classes easily.
+ Somewhat tied to the Multivariate Normal assumption.
+ Derive from either
  + Bayes classifier and Bayes Theorem, or
  + Ratio of Likelihoods for multivariate normals.


+ Consider
   + Single predictor X
   + Two classes k = 1, 2
   + $f_k(x) \sim Normal(\mu_k, \sigma^2)$  - same SD
   + equal proportion for k = 1, 2 (priors)

+ Compare $f_k(x)$ for k = 1, 2 and assign to whichever is higher.
  + Equivalent to left or right of midway  between two means
    + Left or right of $(\mu_1 + \mu_2)/2$

---
# LDA - Multivariate, Multiple Classes

<!-- Plot for 3 classes, with X1 and X2.
   ISLR Fg 4.6 -->

+ Discriminant function
   + Univarite predictor: $\hat{\delta}_k(x) = x \frac{\hat\mu_k}{\hat\sigma^2} âˆ’ \frac{\hat\mu^2_k}{2\sigma^2} +log(\pi_k)$
   + Multivariate form: $\hat{\delta}_k(x) = x^T \hat\Sigma^{-1}\hat\mu_k âˆ’ .5\hat\mu^T_k\hat\Sigma^{-1}\hat\mu_k +log(\pi_k)$

+ For new observation, get x
   +  Compute $\delta_k(x)$ for each class k and assign to the class with the maximum value.

+ Linear in X
+ Multiple (k) classification boundaries - each separating the different Multivariate Normal distributions

+ Assumes same covariance matrix for each class.

+ Covariance matrix indicates the correlation between the predictors - $X_1$, $X_2$, ...


---
# Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

+ When the different classes have different variance-covariance matrices.


+ $\delta_k(x) = âˆ’.5 x^T\Sigma_k^{-1} x + x^T \Sigma_k^{-1} \mu_k  âˆ’ .5 \mu_k^T\Sigma_k^{âˆ’1}\mu_k
  âˆ’.5log\vert\Sigma_k\vert + log(\pi_k)$

+ Quadratic in x in first term.

+ Consider for p = 1, one predictor, and k = 2 Normals with different variances
  + Now take variances into account, and not just mid point between two means
  + Still comparing posteriors, but suppose equal $\pi_k$, so compare densities.
<!-- check in blye book -->

+ If actually different covariance matrices
   + Bias in our assumption $\Sigma_k = \Sigma$ 
   + But decrease variance because better estimate of $\Sigma$.

+ If actually same covariance matrices
   + QDA has higher variance in estimates
   + No actual bias.


---
# Comparison of Methods
<!-- See Figure 4.11 and scenarios. p166
     kNN-1 uniformly  dominated. Never best.

     Comparisons don't take into account that logistic could have been fit on the
     derived variables X^2 X1*X2 used to create the boundaries.  Some EDA may have
     discovered this.
     But back to bias variance trade-off.
   -->

+ Each works "best" if its assumptions actually hold.

+ kNN works well (better than LDA/QDA) when the decision boundaries are highly non-linear
  + kNN > QDA  > LDA
  + QDA borrows "strength"/information from Normality, but gives flexibility.

+ Can we get increased non-linearity in QDA with derived variables, e.g. $X_1^2$, $log(X_2)$?
   + Still need the normality to hold for all variables.
   + So may have to omit $X_2$ if bringing in $log(X_2)$ as both not likely to be Normal.

+ Can add these to logistic regression relatively easily.
   + Have to deal with collinearity.



---

# Classification & Regression Trees

+ Fit a simple "stump"
   + Best variable that separates the Ys
   + Find best variable and best point at which it splits.

+ Divide data based on split
   + classify within each group based on majority vote

+ Repeat on each of the 2 divisions of the data
   + Recursively build a tree.

+ Measures of fit
  + misclassification rate $(1 - max_k (p_k))$
  + Gini $-\Sigma_k p_k (1-p_k)$
  + entropy $-\Sigma_k p_k log(p_k)$


+ Greedy

+ Parametric or Non-parametric?



---
# Ensembles

---
Bagging

+ General approach
  + Talk about it wrt. classification trees.

+ Trees are "unstable"

---
# Random Forest

+ Use Bagging
  + generate new bootstrap sample
  + fit a tree

+ But when deciding each split/branch in the tree,
   + use a random subset of covariates

+ Say p covariates, $X_1, ..., X_p$
  + Use, say, $m = sqrt(p)$ covariates
  + Select at random, and find best split.
  + Different set of candidate covariates at each split!

---

# Why does Random Forest work?

--

+ The trees would ordinarily be  correlated.
+ Different data, but same predictors.
+ Dominant covariates (ones that are good predictors) will be used most of the time.
+ Remove these at random allows them to be used, but not all the time.
+ Different trees will be less correlated.

---
# Boosting

+ An ensemble method

+ Concept:
   + Using a classification model 
   + Fit the model to the training data
   + For the observations we misclassify, increase their relative weights.
   + Fit the classifier again with the new weights to create the next model
   + Repeat M times, creating M different classifiers

   + For a new test observation, classify it with each of the M classifiers.
     +  Combine votes, using weights for the votes
     +  Increased weight for classifier that was more accurate.


+ Each successive model uses information from the previous fitted model
  + Focus successively on hard to classify observations.

+ Weights on the hard to fit observations increase, but the overall accuracy of the resulting classifier decreases.
   + That classifier contributes something to be able to adapt to the hard to predict observations, areas where the original classifier didn't do well.
   + But does not contribute as much in overall vote as the initial classifier as it isn't as accurate overall.

+ Relies on the basic classifier at each step being better than guessing, but only just.
   + error rate < 50%

+ Converts weak learner to a strong learner

+ Reduces bias and variance.

---

# Boosting

### AdaBoost Algorithm/Steps

+ Set weights for each observation $w_i = 1/N, i = 1, 2, ..., N$

+ Repeat M times  (number of times we boost)
  + Fit classifier $G_m(x)$ to the training data using current weights $w_i$
  + Compute error rate for $G_m(x)$
$$  err_m = \frac{\Sigma_i^N  w_i I(y_i \ne G_m(x_i))}{\Sigma_i^N w_i}$$

  + Compute $\alpha_m = log( (1 - err_m)/err_m )
     
  +  Update weights for next iteration with
$$ w_i = w_i  exp( \alpha_m I(y_i \ne G_m(x_i))),  i = 1, 2, ..., N  $$

      + only change weights for observations we got wrong.

  + Back to next iteration

+ Overall classifier
   $$G(x) = sign ( \Sigma_m^M \alpha_m G_m(x) )$$


---

# Boosting

## Other Conceptual Frameworks

+ After fitting a model, fit a model to the residuals.

+ Fit model $Y = G_1(x) + \hbox{residual}$.
+ Fit second model $\hbox{residual} = G_2(x) + \hbox{residual}_2$
+ Fit third model $\hbox{residual}_2 = G_2(x) + \hbox{residual}_3$

+ Now combine
   $$ Y = \alpha_1 G_1(x) + \alpha_2 G_2(x) + \alpha_3 G_3(x) $$


+ Shrink the residuals each step.


+ Boosting can overfit.


---

# Support Vector Machine - SVM

+ Maximal margin classifier - separable case
+ Non-separable case.


---

# NaÃ¯ve Bayes

+ Consider classifying an email as HAM/SPAM

+ Each observation is an email.
+ Label - SPAM = True or False

+ Response Y = label
+ Predictors/Covariates ?

+ Need to create variables from the email message

+ Email message consists of
   + Header containing metadata
   + body
   + 0 or more attachments, each of which hs
     + Header
     + body

+ Can measure anything about the email, but clearly want variables
that help us to predict/discriminte between SPAM and HAM.

+ Take a subset to do feature engineering.
   + Don't snoop on the entire data set. Otherwise can't validate whether this is
  real or specific/overfitting to the current sample.


---

# Bayes Theorem

+ $$P(\hbox{message is spam} |\hbox{message content: "Are your taxes too high?"})$$

+ Bayes Theorem
$$P(\hbox{message is spam} | \hbox{message content}) = \frac{P(\hbox{message content} | \hbox{spam})P(\hbox{spam})}{P(\hbox{message content})}$$


+ We care about the ratio of the probabilities $P(spam|message content)/$P(not spam|message content)$
  + So denominator term common to both cancels.
  + So looking at
$$\frac{P(\hbox{message content} | \hbox{spam})P(\hbox{spam})}{\frac{P(\hbox{message content} | \hbox{NOT spam})P(\hbox{NOT spam})}$$

+ We have sample estimates for $P(\hbox{spam})$ and $P(\hbox{NOT spam})$
  + Just sample proportions.

---
# Naive Bayes

+ Problem is $P(\hbox{message content} | \hbox{spam})$ and for NOT spam.

+ Looking at joint distribution of words in email
  + Order of words important.

+ Simplifying assumption: presence or absence of a word  is independent of other words.
  + $P("high" in email | "taxes" in email AND is spam ) = P("high" in email | is spam)$;
  + $P("high" not in email |"taxes" in email AND is spam) = P("high" in email | is spam)$

+ So
$$P(message content| spam) = P("apple" not in email | spam) P("bob" not in email | spam)...P(high in email| spam) P(hit not in email) ... P(taxes in email| spam) ...$$
  + Note we need to have a term for all of the words.
